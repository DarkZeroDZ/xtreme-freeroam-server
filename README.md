History

The gamemode was developed at the end of 2010. At that time I collected my first scripting experiences. I learned scripting with this gamemode. Therefore it is not very well done. 
This script has been used from the end of 2010 until july 2011 as clanserver for my first clan, [TL] - The Lost.
Therefore this gamemode was not used for a long time. Around the middle of 2012, there was a small cleanup, because there was one guy interested in this gamemode. He also used the gamemode for a short period of time. Since then, about september 2012, the gamemode is rotting on my PC. So here we go.

Enjoy!
